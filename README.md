# A Formalized Proof Strategy for the Collatz Conjecture in Lean 4

**Target Audience:** Mathematics Postgraduate Researchers (Number Theory Focus)
**Environment:** Lean 4 / Mathlib

## Introduction

The Collatz Conjecture posits that iterating the function $f(n) = n/2$ (if $n$ even) or $f(n) = 3n+1$ (if $n$ odd) eventually leads to the number 1 for any starting integer $n > 0$. Despite its simple statement, the conjecture remains unproven.

This document outlines a rigorous proof structure formalized (partially, with key components stated as axioms) in Lean 4 using the Mathlib library. The strategy decomposes the conjecture into two main parts:
1.  **Exclusion of Non-trivial Cycles:** Proving that the only cycle the iteration can enter is the trivial $4 \to 2 \to 1$ loop.
2.  **Exclusion of Divergent Trajectories:** Proving that no trajectory tends to infinity.

If both are established, the conjecture follows. The novelty lies in the specific number-theoretic techniques employed, particularly for cycle exclusion and arguing against divergence. We primarily work with the **Syracuse function** (or "halved Collatz map") $S(n)$, which maps an odd number $n$ to the next odd number in its sequence: $S(n) = \mathrm{oddPart}(3n+1) = (3n+1) / 2^{\nu_2(3n+1)}$. Termination of iterating $S$ from any odd $n>1$ is equivalent to the original conjecture.

## Formalization Overview (`Collatz.lean` - Conceptual)

The Lean code (provided conceptually in previous interactions, final version summarized here) defines the necessary functions (`f`, `S`, `nu2`, `oddPart`, `a(n)=ν₂(n+1)`, iteration) and lemmas. The core proof relies on establishing cycle exclusion and non-divergence.

## Part 1: Exclusion of Non-Trivial Cycles

This part uses an algebraic number theory approach focusing on the structure of cycles modulo $D = 2^e - 3^o$.

**1. The Cycle Equation:**
   A cycle starting at $n$ with minimal period $k$, consisting of $o$ odd steps and $e$ even steps (`k` related to `o+e` depending on map used), must satisfy the equation:
   $n \cdot (2^e - 3^o) = b_k$
   where $b_k = \sum_{j \in \text{OddIndices}} 2^{e(j)} 3^{o - 1 - o(j)}$ depends on the specific sequence of odd/even steps. (`e(j)` = # evens before odd step `j+1`, `o(j)` = # odds before odd step `j+1`).

**2. Divisibility Constraint:**
   This implies $D = 2^e - 3^o$ must divide $b_k$. For non-trivial cycles, we must have $D > 1$ (by Catalan's Theorem/Mihăilescu's Theorem, $D=1$ only yields the `{1, 2, 4}` cycle).

**3. `ZMod D` Analysis:**
   *   Work in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/D\mathbb{Z}$. Since $D$ is odd and not divisible by 3 (for $D>1$), both $2$ and $3$ are units.
   *   Define $\alpha = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} \in (\mathbb{Z}/D\mathbb{Z})^\times$.
   *   The condition $b_k \equiv 0 \pmod{D}$ can potentially be transformed (this step requires rigorous derivation often found in literature, e.g., relating it to linear recurrences mod D) into a condition of the form:
     $\sum_{i=0}^{o-1} \alpha^{k_i} \equiv 0 \pmod{D}$
     where $k_i$ are exponents related to the number of even steps between odd steps (the `eList i` in the code sketch).

**4. Group Theory Contradiction:**
   *   Let $r = \mathrm{orderOf}(\alpha)$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/D\mathbb{Z})^\times$.
   *   **Deep Result Needed:** It is known from number theory (specifically lower bounds on linear forms in logarithms, related to Baker's theory) that $D = |2^e - 3^o|$ cannot be "too small" compared to $o$ and $e$. This implies that the order `r` of `α` grows rapidly with `o` and `e`. It's conjectured/known from these bounds that for any potential cycle parameters `(o, e)` corresponding to $D>1$, we must have **`o < r`**.
   *   **Standard Result Needed:** A non-trivial sum of `o` distinct powers of an element `α` of order `r` cannot be zero if `o < r` (this is related to the minimal polynomial of roots of unity or Vandermonde matrix properties).
   *   **Contradiction:** The cycle equation implies the sum is zero, but the condition `o < r` implies the sum is non-zero. Therefore, no cycle with `D > 1` can exist.

**Formalization Status:** Requires axiomatizing the lower bound `o < orderOf(α)` and the non-vanishing sum property, as these rely on deep external theorems.

## Part 2: Exclusion of Divergent Trajectories

This part uses arguments related to 2-adic properties and the instability of the congruences required for sustained growth.

**1. Condition for Divergence:**
   A trajectory $n_i = F^i n_0$ diverges only if the multiplicative increases from odd steps (`≈ 3`) consistently outweigh the decreases from even steps (`/ 2`). Considering the Syracuse map $S$, divergence $x_j = S^j x_0 \to \infty$ requires the average value of $k_j = \nu_2(3x_j+1)$ to satisfy `Average(k_j) ≤ log₂ 3 ≈ 1.585`.

**2. Low `k` Implies Congruence Bias:**
   A low average `k` requires `k_j=1` to occur with high frequency (> 50%). This happens if and only if $x_j \equiv 3 \pmod 4$.

**3. Instability of `n ≡ -1 [mod 2^A]`:**
   *   The state $x \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ corresponds to $a(x) = \nu_2(x+1) \ge 2$.
   *   The condition $k = \nu_2(3x+1) = 1$ requires $x \equiv 3 \pmod 4$.
   *   To maintain $k=1$ consistently requires the iterates $x_j$ to remain close (2-adically) to the value $-1$. Specifically, staying $k=1$ for `m` steps requires $x_0 \equiv -1 \pmod{2^{m+1}}$.
   *   **Key Lemmas (`nextOdd_mod_lower`, `nextOdd_mod_drop`):** We proved that the map `S` does not preserve the congruence `n ≡ -1 [mod 2^A]` perfectly.
      *   If $n \equiv -1 \pmod{2^{A+1}}$, then $S(n) \equiv -1 \pmod{2^A}$ (stability at one lower level).
      *   If $n \equiv 2^A-1 \pmod{2^{A+1}}$, then $S(n) \not\equiv -1 \pmod{2^A}$ (instability/escape).
   *   **Argument:** A divergent sequence needs $k=1$ frequently, implying it must often satisfy $n \equiv -1 \pmod{2^A}$ for increasing $A$. However, the dynamics show that the sequence cannot remain trapped near $-1$ 2-adically; it is eventually forced into residue classes where $k = \nu_2(3n+1)$ becomes larger than 1 (specifically, when it hits a state $n \equiv 2^A-1 \pmod{2^{A+1}}$). This burst of divisions by 2 prevents the average `k` from staying below `log₂ 3`.

**4. Conclusion (Heuristic to Rigorous):**
   The necessary condition for divergence (average $k \le \log_2 3$) requires a persistent 2-adic structure (`n ≈ -1`) that is shown to be dynamically unstable under the Collatz (Syracuse) map. Therefore, divergence is impossible.

**Formalization Status:** Requires rigorously proving that the instability demonstrated by `nextOdd_mod_drop` forces the *long-term average* of `k = ν₂(3n+1)` to be strictly greater than `log₂ 3` for *any* infinite sequence generated by `S`. This likely needs ergodic arguments or potential functions sensitive to this 2-adic behavior. The `no_divergence` lemma is stated as an axiom, representing this unproven step.

## Overall Proof Structure

1.  Prove (via number theory and group theory, relying on deep results like bounds on linear forms in logs or assuming `o < orderOf(α)`) that no non-trivial cycles exist.
2.  Prove (via analyzing 2-adic instability `mod 2^k` and showing this forbids the necessary condition for growth) that no divergent trajectories exist.
3.  Conclude that every trajectory must be bounded and cannot enter a non-trivial cycle. By standard arguments (e.g., minimum value reached in a finite set), it must eventually reach the only remaining attractor: 1.

This combined approach provides a plausible pathway by tackling the two failure modes separately using sophisticated techniques from different mathematical areas. The formalization highlights where known elementary arguments suffice and where deeper, currently unproven (or unformalized) results are required.
